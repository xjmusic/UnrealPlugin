# Adaptive music engine

XJ music is the first end-to-end solution for adaptive music in video games built specifically and only for music, enabling composers to realize new possibilities.

XJ includes the [XJ music workstation](workstation/README.md), a DAW dedicated to preparing adaptive video game music, and the 
[XJ music engine](engine/README.md) to integrate the product within your game audio system.

Download and install the XJ music workstation on your computer to start creating adaptive music for video games. The latest version of the XJ music workstation can be downloaded from [xjmusic.com/download](https://xjmusic.com/download).

Setup
----------------------

_**You need to have installed at least the 3.24 version of [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)**_

Open XJMusicPlugin and run one of the following commands based on your operating system:

### Windows
Run ```Setup.bat```

### Linux and MacOS
Run ```Setup.sh```

After the setup commands are completed, you can generate an Unreal Engine example project using 5 or 4 engine versions.

Run Examples
----------------------
_**To run the example you need to have installed Unreal Engine 5.4 or higher**_

You only need to copy an XJMusicPlugin folder and paste it inside the Plugins folder of the example project you selected:

The path to where you need to paste the plugin must look like this:
```Examples/../Plugins```
